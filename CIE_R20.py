This app divides **Total Marks (out of 40)** into:
- **Part A**: Random value between 0 to 5
- **Part B**: Remaining marks (max 15), distributed among any 3 out of 5 questions (Q1‚ÄìQ5)
  - Each selected question gets **1 to 5 marks**
  - Remaining 2 questions are **blank**

---

‚úÖ **Instructions**:
1. Upload an Excel (`.xlsx`) or CSV (`.csv`) file with a column named **`Total Marks`**
2. App will compute marks distribution
3. Download the result as an Excel file
